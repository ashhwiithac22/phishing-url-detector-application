Phishing URL Detection Web Application 🔐

A Python-based web application that detects whether a URL is legitimate ✅ or phishing ❌ using machine learning. Built with Streamlit for an intuitive UI and trained with a feature-rich dataset of URLs.

Features
1. URL Classification
Predicts whether a given URL is legitimate or phishing

Uses a trained machine learning model (Logiatic regression and Linear Regression)

Highlights risky patterns commonly used in phishing links

2. Feature Extraction
Extracts over 30 lexical, domain-based, and content-based features from the URL

Key features include:


URL length

Use of '@' symbols, redirections, subdomains

HTTPS usage

3. Interactive Web Interface
Built with Streamlit for fast and user-friendly interaction

Simple textbox to enter any URL

Real-time prediction with explanation of prediction confidence

4. Model Training Script
Train your own model using the provided phishing_dataset.csv

Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Save the trained model as a .pkl file for deployment
